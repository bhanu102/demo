cloning the git repo into your local machine:
git clone "GitHub_repository_URL"

After making any changes you need to commit and track them:
git add . or git add --all
git commit -m "Added new dependency"

So, the next step will be pushing these changes to the remote repository(GitHub)
git push origin "branch_name"

If you need to pull any changes from remote repo to local repo use the following command:
git pull origin "branch_name"

To check the current branch you are in:
git branch

Check already existing branches:
git branch -a

To check the status of the repo:
git status

version history can be checked using:
git log

To add a remote origin in local repo:
git remote add origin "GitHub_repository_URL"
